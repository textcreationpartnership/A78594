            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere was formerly a <hi>Narrative</hi> published, giving thee an Account of the <hi>Choosing, Coming together, Secluding of some,</hi> and <hi>Sitting of the rest</hi> of the late <hi>Parliament</hi> (so called,) as also of the things that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, the Act for the <hi>Excise</hi> imposing it for ever (with the <hi>Customes</hi>) as a standing Revenue to the <hi>Crown;</hi> and letting it out to Farm, to the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oppression of the People, setting up Patentees to Rule them at pleasure. Thirdly, An <hi>Act</hi> for a three Years Tax to pay the Sould<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And to name but one more (for brevity sake) Fourthly, an <hi>Act</hi> for a <hi>High Court</hi> (so called) of <hi>Justice,</hi> for the Preservation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors Person, as if the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> were not as sufficient to protect him now, as when he was <hi>General,</hi> but an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Illegal Court</hi> must be erected in a time of Peace, to take away the Lives of persons at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>There is likewise in that <hi>Na rative</hi> a Catalogue, or an Account given of One hundred eighty two of the Members of that unworthy Assembly, who were Sons, Kinsmen, Servants, and otherwise engaged unto, and had Places of Profit, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Sallaries,<note n="*" place="margin">Which amounts unto in the whole, one million sixteen thousand three hundred and seventeen pounds sixteen shillings and eight pence <hi>per An.</hi> according to the favourablest computation by the former Narrative, or Book of Rates. As it was said there, so, here: If there be any mistakes, they are desired who best know, to rectifie them; if not, then what is here mentioned may be taken for granted. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not eat the bread of the Governour; why must so great Sallaries be continued to them who have gotten so much already. The Taxes raised from the people to pay this, doth ruine thousands.</note> and Advantages under the Protector, (so called) whereby it doth appear, what fine Suckers they are of the Riches and Fatnesse of this Common-wealth, and how unlikely they were, being so back'd for his Interest, and so well seasoned with the Salt of his Palace, (<hi>Ezra</hi> 4.14.) to bring forth

               </gap>d for Rights and Liberties of the People. After some Queries proposed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, follows a Catalogue of the <hi>Kinglings,</hi> or the Names of those Seventy persons, (most of them being the Protectors Kinsmen, and Sallary-men) that voted for <hi>Kingship,</hi> with the Counties for which they served, that so they may be remembred, and called to an account hereafter. After this, there is mentioned, how that the New Government, of the <hi>Humble Petition</hi> and <hi>Advice,</hi> pretended by them to be then settled, was carried in the <hi>House</hi> and by three Voices, fifty three against fifty; as also that it was contrary to the Desires of the good people of the Nation, but not being able at that time to get the Names of those fifty three persons, who also hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oned.</p>
            <p>You have also those Members of that Assembly, who though they gave not their Vote either for Kingship, or the then Government by the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice,</hi> but pretended to be against, and dissatisfaction with both, sharply, and justly reproved, for betraying the <hi>Trust</hi> committed to them by the People. First, for being so Sneaking, and Cowardly in their Spirits, as to suffer their Fellow Members to be Secluded from them; and the Council, who had nothing to do with it, so to intrenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as to let none sit but whom they approved of. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For being so ready to comply to <hi>Sit,</hi> or <hi>Adjourn</hi> at the Protectors pleasure, as if they were his Servants, and not he theirs. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That when they saw the Liberties of the People endeavoureed to be violated afresh by the <hi>Kinglings,</hi> and also really given away by the afore-mentioned fifty three persons, who petitioned and advised the <hi>Protector</hi> (so called) to take the <hi>Government</hi> upon him, and to chuse his Successour; they did not Cry out, Protest, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against, and withdraw from them, which being their duty they ought to have done; in doing whereof, those unparallel'd wickednesses would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity have fallen to the ground: but instead thereof went on with them, stifeling their own Consciences, and endeavouring to satisfie their oppressed Brethren, by saying, <hi>He had not the Title of King;</hi> as if all the Evill; Oppression, and Arbitrarinesse lay in that; when as at the same time, he hath the same, and no lesse power, then if he had the Title, and were called King. Yea, a far greater Power then what cost so much Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to oppose in the late <hi>King;</hi> and that these slight Pretences would not be Plea sufficient to excuse them, in the day of their Account for so doing. After which, some general Queries being soberly proposed as a close to the whole, is the Conclusion of that <hi>Narrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here thou wilt finde related some of the most remarkable Passages which occur'd in their second Session, with the end, and dissolution of the whole, after two or three Weeks sitting. As also something of another <hi>House,</hi> (though Namelesse yet) covertly intended for a <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152623:3"/> with a Description of forty three of them, by all which thou mayest be able in some measure to resolve thy thoughts concerning the change of the</hi> Cause <hi>and</hi> Principles, <hi>which these great Masters formerly carried on, and profess to do so still. It is notoriously known how even the chief of them sometime said,</hi> It would never be well, neither should we ever see good Dayes, whilest there was one Lord left in <hi>England,</hi> nor untill you <hi>(speaking so to him)</hi> my Lord of <hi>Manchester</hi> be called Mr. <hi>Montague: yet now new Lords must he made by the dozens. What Declaring, what Fighting hath there been? and how much Blood and Treasure spent against a</hi> Negative Voyce, <hi>in the King and Lords? Yet now, not onely the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector <hi>himself, forsooth, but all his new upstart Lords, such as were our equals, or it may be below us, must Lord it over us with their No, to our I. Is not the World grown mad? were there ever such wonders before? To fancy what after Ages will think of these men, who pretend to be of the Saints of these times, will never make a person melancholy that shall be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in it. Not to trouble thee further, eye God more, and Men lesse, and that will stay and quiet thy Spirit: and say to thy self as the Psalmist did,</hi> (Psal. 62.5, 9.) My soul wait thou onely upon God, for my expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from him. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye.</p>

This being done day by day, and the <hi>House</hi> not agreeing what to call that <hi>Other House,</hi> which was as it were a namelesse Infant, and fain would be named the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> was the greatest part of their work, save that now and then, some little Matters came under Debate, as the Reviving and perfecting their Commitees, and Reading some former Bills. The Lord <hi>Graven's</hi> Case also was taken in, and the Council on both parts heard at the Bar of the House, with some other little Matters, that passed; but the greatest part of time that was spent in the House, (whilest sitting) was in Considering and Debating what they should call the <hi>Other House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the end of their sitting, there came another Message from the <hi>Other House,</hi> after the same manner as before, <hi>Desiring their joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them, in moving the Protector to Order, that the Papists, and such as had been in Armes under the late King, might be exiled the City, and put out of the Lines of Communication &amp;c.</hi> This Message being also designed as a shooing-horn, to draw on their owning of them, received a like Answer as did the former.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Other House</hi> (who called themselves the <hi>House of Lords</hi>) they spent their time in little Matters, such as choosing of Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, and among other things, to consider of the Priviledges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of their House, (good wise souls) before they knew what their House was, or should be called.</p>
            <p>About which time also, a Petition was preparing, by some faithful Friends to the good <hi>Old Cause,</hi> in, and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> which was afterward Printed, and signed with many thousand Hands: which Petition makes mention of the several Particulars that were the Grounds of Contest between the late King, and Parliament, and the good People of the Nation. And prayeth, <hi>The settling these good things fought for, as the Reward and Fruit of the Blood and Treasure so greatly expended in the late Wars, &amp;c.</hi> This Petition was ready to be presented
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152623:5"/> to the Parliament (in a peaceable way) by the hands of about twenty in the name of the rest, desiring to submit the issue thereof to God, and the Wisdom of that Assembly. The Court hearing of it, were so affrighted, as they began to consider how they might quell and put a stop to that honest Spirit, which so appeared against them; the Protector (in the mean while) calling them <hi>Traytors, and Seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp;c.</hi> Threatning <hi>to cut their Sculls, and to tread them down as mire in the streets, &amp;c.</hi> And turning out<note n="†" place="margin">As Major <hi>Packer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kiffin,</hi> and others, by endeavouring to promote the Apostacy at its first Rise, hath occasioned many bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized persons, and others, simply to wander after the Beast. They now seeing their Errour, ought they not to declare it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as also to stir them up to keep close with more refinednesse in their Spirits to the good Old Cause, and to be for no single Person whatsoever, till he comes, whose Right it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21 26.</note> Major <hi>Packer,</hi> and most of the honestest Officers of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horse, for refusing to serve his Lust there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And apprehendsng that nothing could do it, but a speedy dissolving the Parliament, they put on Resolutions accordingly, onely, waited for a convenient opportunity. But something happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that morning, that put the Protector into a Rage and Passion, neer unto madnesse, (as those at <hi>White-Hall</hi> can witnesse) he gets into a Coach, and to the <hi>Other House</hi> he comes, and sends for his son <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Fines,</hi> and some others, acquainting them what his Purpose and Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, and what he came to do, (who as it's said) earnestly endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to disswade him from it; but he refused to hearken, and in great passion sware <hi>By the living God he would dissolve them.</hi> And so going into the <hi>House,</hi> and sending the <hi>Black Rod</hi> with a Message, to call the Parliament to come unto him, He with laying great blame upon them, and charging them with great Crimes, and Magnifying of himself (as his manner is) dissolved them. And this was the fourth Parliament broken by him in five years.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Two Houses</hi> fell and perished together; their Father, their good Father, knocking his Children on the Head, and killing of them, because they were not towardly, but did wrangle one with another; but what hath he gained thereby? <hi>Solomon</hi> the wise saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Every wise woman buildeth her house, but the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>First, Whether there may not very plainly be read and perceived, a Hand of Displeasure from the <hi>Almighty,</hi> blinding the eyes, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuing the understandings of those unworthy persons, who (<note n="*" place="margin">1 Kings 16.34.</note>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152623:5"/> good people of these Lands) so as to cause, or suffer them to do their work by halves? and to rise, and leave so Lame, Namelesse, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant their <hi>New Modell</hi> of the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice, (alias</hi> Instrument of Bondage to the English Nation.)

                  <hi>Babel</hi> be considered of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether those so very wise Gentlemen, who saw it so necessary, and ventured so high, and took so much pains, to bring in again, and anew restore fallen <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Kingship</hi> in these Lands, could according to the rules of common reason and understanding of men, imagine and conclude, That the Gentlemen who had formerly been so wronged, abused, and exasperated by them, in being kept out of the House, would be so easie and tame, as presently, without any more ado, addresse themselves to lick their new <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and nurse up that <hi>Babylonish, Antichristian</hi> Brat, they had no hand in, but were against the begetting of?

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether the good people of this Nation have not cause for e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er as to abhor the Memory of the afore-mentioned back-sliding persons, so that Parliament (so called) in the first Session of it before their Adjourning, that of their own Heads, and contrary to their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to the<note n="*" place="margin">The first Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not hereby owned, but abhorred as much as the latter, though I thus speak.</note> Instrument of Government; by vertue whereof they sate at first, and without consulting the respective Counties for whom they served, or so much as one Petition delivered to them for that purpose, changed the Government, and made one worse, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and more grievous to be born, then that they put away; so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening their new Iron yoke upon the Necks of the good People of this Land, settling great <hi>Taxes,</hi> with the <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>Excise</hi> for ever, to keep this Yoke upon them?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether those Gentlemen kept out in the first Sitting, when those hard things were transacted, and afterwards comming in, and being present in the second Meeting, notwithstanding the so great Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oach and Dirt cast on them by the Court, are not highly to be honoured and esteemed, for appearing and standing so far as they did, for <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> and against the Bondages, which contrary to <hi>Ingagements, Covenants,</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> were put upon the good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Land? As well as to be blamed, not onely for not declaring at their first Seclusion, to inform the People of the wrong and injury
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152623:6"/> done unto them; But also, when afterward they were so Arbitrarily and Tyrannically dissolved, with the rest of their unworthy Brethren, they took it so patiently, and went so tamely home, and did not in the very time of the Action, Protest and Declare against the Tyrant, and then retire into their places, (from whence they ought not to have stirred at first) and call him to the Bar, or otherwise proceeded against him for so doing? Had it not been sutable to, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that noble Commonwealth-Spirit (so much pretended to) thus to have assay'd, though they had fallen in it? And whether the Army in Honesty, Conscience and Duty, their former Declarations and Ingagements considered, ought not to have assisted them therein, as well as they did the long Parliament against the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> upon the like account? Doth not the loud cryes of the Souls of the Saints<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10.</note> under the Altar, slain for the Testimony which they held in their Day, as also the blood of the Saints and others slain in the late Wars, and the Sufferings of our dear Brethren in Prisons and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, call for this their Testimony also? If so; Ought not this honest word of Reproof for what is past, and of excitation for the future to take place?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, But since things were as they were, and as it seems could be no better, whether all good People in these Nations, have not great cause exceedingly to blesse and praise the Lord? (though they owe little to the Instrument) who (<hi>Ashur</hi>-like had other ends) that the late Parliament (so called) was dissolved; who were many of them, such Mercenary, Salary, and self-interested men, as in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, had they continued much longer, would have over-voted the Lovers of Freedom, and so have perfected their Instrument of Bondage, and rivetted it on the Necks of the good People for ever by a Law, and thereby made them Vassals and Slaves perpetually. But hitherto the Lord hath in a great measure frustrated their wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, blessed be his holy Name.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whether the Protector (so called) be not a great destroyer of the Rights and Liberties of the English Nation? for hath he not ingrossed the whole power of the <hi>Militia</hi> into his own hand? The Right also of Property? Power of judging all matters of the highest and greatest Concernment? And doth he not take on him to be sole Judge of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> of Calling and Dissolving Parliaments? Raising Money without Consent in Parliament? Imprisoning persons without due form of Law, and keeping them in Durance at pleasure; using the <hi>Militia</hi> in his own hand against the good people, in these fore-named things, and against their Representers in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Whether the Protector, and the Great men his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152623:6"/> be not rather to be termed <hi>Fanatick, Whimsical</hi> and <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd,</hi> then those, (who remaining firm to, and being more refined in their former, good, and honest Principles, and will upon no account be drawn to desert the good Old Cause) they account and call so? And whether this unsettlednesse in their Government, and changing both it and their Principles, in so short a time; and going so diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically contrary to their former honest Protestations, Declarations, Sermons, and Actings, doth not in the view of all the world, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them so to be?</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Whether the Protector (so called) be not that himself which he untruly charged upon the Members turned out of the Little Parliament (so called) <hi>viz. A destroyer of Magistracy and Ministry?</hi> Of Magistracy, in breaking four Parliaments in five Years; and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up by the roots, what in him lieth, the very Basis and Foundation of all just Power, to wit, the Interest of the good People of this Commonwealth; making himself, and his own Will and Lust, the Basis and Foundation thereof? And doth he not at his pleasure sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and destroy all Military and Civill Power, and Governours that submit not thereunto? Is he not likewise a great destroyer of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, in taking from them their Religious, or Divine Capacities, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into that of <hi>Lay</hi> or <hi>Common?</hi> and accordingly, in a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed way, preferring them to places of Advantage by the Tryers.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Whether the Protector be so wise and understanding, so tender and carefull of the Common Interest (as is pretended to) above all others whatsoever? yea, above and beyond the four Parliaments he hath dissolved? And may it not be enquired how he came to this great height of Knowle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge and absolute understanding, seeing there are very many worthy Patriots, sometimes his Equals (at least) of as high a Discent, of as good breeding, of as great Parts, of as fair an Interest, as also as well versed in Government as himself? Whether it may not be wondered at, that he should be so exceeding wise, and tender above all, even above Parliaments themselves.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Whether Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> Major Generall <hi>Harrison,</hi> the late President <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerigg,</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Ludlow.</hi> with hundreds more of worthy Patriots, that have ventured far in their Countreys Cause, for Justice and Freedom, may not rationally be thought to be as carefull and tender of the good of their Country as the Protector?</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, Whether it doth not rankly savour of high Pride and Arrogancy in the Protector (so called) to set up his Sense and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the standard for the whole Nation, even Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152623:7"/> And whether thus to do, be not the sad fruit of Enthusaisme, one of the great Errours of this day and time?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Whether the Protector being so highly conceited of his own understanding, so changeable and uncertain in his Principles and Resolutions, so given up to his Passion and Anger, as against all Advice and Counsel, in a condition near unto Madnesse, to swear <hi>by the living God</hi> he would Dissolve the late Parliament, and accordingly did so, though the doing of it tended to the hazard of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Whether he according to Reason, can be thought a person capable, and fit to Rule and Governe this so <hi>Great,</hi> so <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> a People?</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, Whether since the Protector assumed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the state and condition of this Nation be not very greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired? Their Land Forces wasted and consumed at <hi>Hispaniola, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, Mardike,</hi> and elsewhere? Their Shipping lessened and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; their Stores and Provisions for Sea and Land expended and consumed without profit; their Magazines emptied; their Treasures wasted; their Trade in a great measure lost and decayed; and very great new Debts contracted, little of Old being satisfied? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all this be not the better fruit of Apostacy and Treachery, and setting up a single person, as Chief Magistrate contrary to Ingagements: And the casting away of that Righteous Cause of Freedom, Justice, and Righteousnesse, this Land was so engaged in?</p>
               <p>Lastly, Whether the Protector (so called) will not in all likelihood dissolve the next Parliament also, if they begin to question and make Debates of former Transactions, and do not presently without any disputing, proceed to perfect the new Modell, of the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice?</hi> What assurance shall be given to the Countries and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that shall chuse, or to the Gentlemen chosen, that they shall not be served as those before were? And whether, if the honest Citizens shall begin to make ready their former sober, and very worthy <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or one of the like natute, it will not be looked at again, as a Crime little lesse then Treason at the Court, and become a means of sudden Dissolution to the next Parliament also? Alas for poor <hi>England!</hi> What will become of thee in the end? How hast thou lost thy self and thy good Old Cause? And whither will these Masters of Bondage car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Thus for the Description and Narrative. Three or four General Quaries are further propounded for a Close to the whole; and it is humbly offered to all ingenious people, and queried.</head>
               <p>First, Whether if it should come to pass (as how soon we know not) that that noble spirit should (like a Lyon raised from sleep) rise again in the English people, such as it was in forty one or forty two, or about that time, whether these Champions with their <hi>Feathers in their Caps,</hi> and their <hi>Wooden Daggers,</hi> and those fifty three persons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to settle the Government by the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice,</hi>

And whether it would not in all likelyhood fare with them and their Dependents the Patentees of the Excise, and all others employed by them, that so oppress and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish the Nation, as formerly it did with them, if not far worse? They may please to think of it at their Leisure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether in these five years now past of the Protectoral Government, that blessed Reformation which the Protector (then General) and other Grandees of the Army so often promised, and for not bringing forth of which they pretend they dissolved the Old-Parliament, hath so been set upon as to make any the least proceed therein? Or rather, hath there not been a gradual and an apparent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsing into those very Evils and Enormities formerly so greatly sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and in some degree broken, but now healed again of their Wound, and flourishing afresh with open face; the spirit of wickedness and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And in particular, that abominable corruption and abuse in the Law, and Administration of Justice, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the Protector (so called) sometime said, <hi>It was not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in a Christian Common-wealth, that some should so enrich and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten themselves in the ruine of others.</hi> So likewise that often complain'd of Grievance of Tythes; touching which he also said, (as was lately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested in an open Court of Judicature, several standing by to witness the truth thereof, to whom the words were spoken) <hi>That if he did not take away Tythes, by the</hi> 3d <hi>of</hi> September <hi>next,</hi> (to wit. 1654.) <hi>or such a time, they should call him the greatest Juggler that ever was, and would juggle in all things else.</hi> Yet is there any thing done in either of these? or any thing gone about tending thereunto, now in these five years? as if it were so, that no fruit would ever grow upon such a Tree, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Monarchical Foundation) which the Lord hath pulled up and cursed, as <hi>the barren Fig-tree</hi> was: onely there is one goodly amendment, to wit a confirmation of the Act for treble damages, to the undoing of many an honest man, that upon conscientious grounds do scruple the payment of them. And as for the Law and the Lawyers, they are as before, if not much worse; and is there any ground of hope that the next five years (should he continue so long) will produce any b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter fruit then the five that are already past?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether this Calculation of these ignoble Lords of the New-Stamp, being of several Complexions, and standing in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Capacities and Relations, having also such dependence upon and lying under so great Engagements unto the Protector, (so
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152623:19"/> called) as his Sons and Kindred, Flattering Courtiers, corrupt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, degenerated Sword-men, and a sort of luke-warm indifferent Country Knights, Gentlemen and Citizens, most of them self-interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salary-men, be not likely (according to the very specious pretence) to prove a brave Balance of Government? And whether the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Land are likely to have their just Rights and Freedoms, or religious men the Liberty of their Consciences by this Constitution, any otherwise, then according to the pleasure of the Protector and the Court? Or than they had in the time of the late King? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Calculation were made to any other end then so?</p>
               <p>Lastly, Whether, all things soberly weighed and considered, the Times be now so happy and blessed, as some do loudly bespeak them to be? And whether for the future we are likely to have such prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, success, and good days, as some so largely promise themselves? and others it may be expected? Or whether such smiling upon old wickedness, and frowning and turning the back upon Righteousness, suppressing its growth, be any comfortable ground of such hope and expectation? Or whether upon the whole Series of things, as they now appear, there be not rather to be expected some sadder matter, if the Lord in mercy prevent not? Let the wise in heart consider.</p>

            <p>THE fore-going Narrative was composing and preparing to have come forth (like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver) in the fittest Season, during the life-time of <hi>Oliver</hi> the late Protector (so called) and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for that end, among other, that as in a Glass he might clearly see his Mutability and Changeableness in his Principles; as also his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>-like T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eachery and Deceit, and how wickedly he had dealt with the Lord, his People, and the Nation, and the Righteous Cause on foot therein; but the Lord having in answer to the earnest Desires and Prayers of some of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remnant, and in great mercy to the Nation, and the good People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152623:20"/> and the righteous cause, removed and taken him out of the way, it was thought fit however to publish it for the sake of his Associates and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates he hath left behind him, who may happily make some use of it; as also that the standers by, yea, the whole Nation, might likewise see and judge of what hath lately fallen out in this our day.</p>
            <p>It is said of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> That he not onely sinned himself, but made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin; and there were those of his Confederates that then sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.34. compared with 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.21, 22.</note> and after he was dead and gone, of whom it is recorded, That they walked in the ways, and departed not from the sins of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin.</p>
            <p>The parallel hereof we have in <hi>England</hi> in this our day: <hi>Oliver</hi> the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector (so called) who (<hi>Jeroboam</hi>-like) so greatly appeared with the People for Justice and Freedom against Oppression, highly professing and declaring for the same, hath sinned in the breach of those Protestations and Declarations, in building again those things he had been so greatly instrumental to destroy; therein surpassing not onely the deeds of the Wicked who were cut off upon the like account, but also of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who never made such Professions and Declarations as he had done.</p>
            <p>There also are of his Confederates (as the Confederates of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>) that sinned with him in his Apostacy and Revolt, and do yet continue in those sins, and walking in his steps now he is dead and gone, as if they took no notice of the displeasure and wrath of God revealed from Heaven against him, in cutting him off for his unrighteousness. <hi>Israel</hi> smarted sorely for their evil, and at last were carryed away Captive: <hi>England</hi> hath likewise suffered, and is brought very low, at Tradesmen of all sorts, Shop-keepers, and others, both in City and Country, find by such sad and woful experience as rhey never did before, nor in the memory of man was the like ever known or heard of: and what may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer, the Lord (who will not be mocked) onely knows.</p>
            <p>For how unworthy are the People of this Generation, not onely the more dark and sordid, but too many who profess to be Saints, and are Pastors and Members of Churches; nay, some who are Mercurial and more high flown, that once spake the Language of <hi>Zion,</hi> and highly appeared for the Good Old Cause, who notwithstanding they have seen the mighty Arm and Power of God displayed, in bringing down the unrighteous, oppressive, high and lofty Ones (with their Foundation) for their unrighteousness and oppression, yet have so far forgotten the Good Old Cause so signally owned from Heaven, and are so besotted and degenerated into a self seeking slavish, and enslaving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as they not onely justifie, but strengthen their hands, who (instead of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing forward with more refinedness in that Work and Cause, leading to what it shall be when the Promises and Prophesies relating to the Kingdom of Christ and Zion shall be fulfilled) have made a Captain or Protector, and are gone back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> (to wit, the old wicked Foundation and things of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy that have been destroyed) and thereby under a new name upholding and keeping the People under the old Oppressions.</p>

Was not the Bishops, and the simple Clergy, who were acted by their fear or favour, formerly condemned by him &amp; others for styling the late &amp; former Kings, Defenders of the Faith, and supreme Head of the Church under Christ; so generally acknowledged in its original to proceed from <hi>Harry</hi> the 8. who for self-ends, not the glory of God, dethron'd the Papal Power in <hi>England,</hi> and took the Popes (usurped) Supremacy and Title of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith,</hi> as well as the Tythes and First-Fruits, upon and to himself.

But these things declare, that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> sucks such sweetness from the great Soveraignty, Honour, and Profit of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> &amp; hath therewith drawn in such a Tincture of that Spirit, which naturally and usually breaths in persons inhabiting those places, as he is loth to be weaned from it; &amp; therefore will, right or wrong, turn in and comply with any thing, so he may keep his interest there: It will be well for him if I am mistaken. But I leave what may further be spoken to this Subject, to a better Pen, who may take it in hand when his Book comes forth in Print. And together with him, that cringing Court-Chaplain <hi>Peter Sterry,</hi> that also bows to what ever is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost, speaking higher then all this, as is credibly reported by several godly men that heard him to their astonishment: holding forth his Bible in the Chappel of White-Hall, he spake to this purpose: That if that were the Word of God, then as certainly that blessed Holy Spirit (meaning the late Protector) was with Christ at the Right Hand of the Father; and if he be there, what may his Family and the People of God now expect from him? for if he were so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and helpful, and so much good influenced from him to them when he was in a mortal State, how much more influence will they have from him now he is in Heaven? the Father, Son, and Spirit, thorow him bestowing gifts &amp; graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon them. And a great deal more to this purpose: and as he spake thus blasphemously of his Father, so the same Spirit running in the aforementioned flattering Addresses, breath'd from him to his Son (the now Protector so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) which also greatly discovers within what walls he breaths: But I shall let the Father pass, and speak a little of the Son his Successor, and in short, a little answer to those flattering, blasphemous, ungodly expressions, couched in the late Addresses to him, as if he were a second <hi>Solomon, Joshua,</hi> or <hi>Elisha.</hi> Oh you blasphemous, lying, flattering Cycophant Addressours in City, Country, Army, &amp;c. or Off-spring of <hi>Thurlo</hi> and <hi>Nedham</hi> the Pamphleteer, who are so ready to cry up <hi>Adonijah</hi> the false, and to cry and keep down <hi>Solomon</hi> the true spirit of Magistracy! give me leave a little to reason with you: What eminent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work of Grace, or of the Image of God, did you ever experience in and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or heard of from others, not acted by a self-seeking, fawning, servile spirit, but truly fearing the Lord?

            <head>A Third Narrative.</head>
            <p>IN the afore-going Narrative, you have an Account of the Actors upon the Stage, in this present Juncture of Time, the eminent Lords of the Other House: It is intended in this Supliment to take a General View of all the Alterations that hath happened, their Rise and Cause; and then consider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Debates in Councel of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The first Original Cause of disturbing the Mindes of the whole Nation of <hi>England,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was the pride of the Bishops, who not contenting themselves with the power set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their hands, in the Days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but invading the Civil-Power, and taking Cognizance of Civil-Causes, and imposing upon the Consciences of the just Religious People, and promoting of New Ceremonies in the Church, gave thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of dislike to the good people of this Nation; they engaging the late King in the Quarrel, the which weakned his power over his Subjects, and gave thereby opportunity for the late Civil and Unnatural War.</p>
            <p>While they were thus building this Fabrick of Ecclesiastical Tyranny, they take to their Aid several of the great men of the Court; and to espouse them into a Quarrel with the people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand aided them in gaining Monopolies of most of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and staple-commodities of the Nation: all which discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented the people in such sort, that the Kings Commanders were every where disobeyed, and slighted by his Subjects: insomuch,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152623:26"/> that when he waged war with the <hi>Scots,</hi> he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted such great debts, that he was necessitated to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which Authority, the Subjects w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld not submit to payments of any kind whatsoever. A Pacification is made with the <hi>Scots,</hi> in hopes to make use of these Arms raised to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them if they would thereupon have layed down their Arms. Then the Arms in the Kings hands, should have been made use of to awe the English Nation, and reduce them to conform to the exorbitants, and Illegal wiles of the corrupt Ministers of State. But that prevailing not, a second Parliament is called, and made triennial: they disband both Armies, and take upon them to question divers who had abused the King and Kingdom; the King suffereth some of his friends to fall into their hands: others he defends by taking Arms, and settleth a Commission of Array, contrary to the advice of his Council: who advised him not to put his life and power, into the Scales of an uncertain War: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, since that upon the aforegoing considerations, of his people being incensed by the invading of their Liberties and just Rights, his disadvantages were the greater on every hand; and it would give the greater advantage to factious Spirits desiring of change, to carry it on with greater vigor and ods by far, then any designs that ever was carried on against any of his Predecessors; And that it were better for him to give away all then lose all: and that it was better for him, to grant that which they could rest from him, by which means he might secure himself and posterity; and also that it would be greater glory for him to Rule Princes, then be a Prince of slaves, for no better were his people at that day. This was the advice of a Noble person, that followed him in all his wars, to the losse of his Estate and ruin of his Family. Well, the King is in Arms, the Parliament Armes also: the Parliament begins to Levy vast sums on publick faith. The King useth such other means by his friends, as putteth him in a condition to take the field with a powerful Army. Several Battels fought with various events: the King is Master of the field at first. The Parliament become Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians to draw in the <hi>Scots</hi> to their aid. At length the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment new Moddeleth their Army, in which <hi>Cromwel</hi> is a person of no small ranke. The King declineth in power and loseth, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himself to the <hi>Scots,</hi> who sell him for 200000 <hi>li.</hi>

            <p>Addresses are made to the King during his restraint by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my when he was at <hi>Oatlands.</hi> When the City of <hi>London</hi> and part of the Parliament oppos'd, the Army prevaile by their approach only to the City, the Tower, all Forts, and Magazines are surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to them. Now they fear their applications to the King, the King is got by a trick into the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to make way for the after-game.</p>
            <p>He is not long after beheaded as a Tyrant, Traytor, and grand Incendiary: the Nation is declared a Free State, during which time, great and horrid injustice and abuses were committed, to the shame and infamy of that Parliament. <hi>

                  </gap>omwel</hi> being now arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the dignity of Commander in chief, over all the Forces of the three Nations; in it he planteth Anabaptists, to poyze with the Independants and Presbyterians, who were the friends of the Parliament. The Parliament foreseeing the underhand dealing of the Army to play into <hi>Cromwel's</hi> hand, Resolved to dissolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and call a new Representative; but <hi>Cromwel</hi> preventeth them, and forcibly dissolveth them, under pretence of the heavy burthens that yet continued upon the people, and his Army ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
            <p>Now, you must suppose the people of <hi>England</hi> a Free People indeed, after the expence of both sides, had cost the Nation of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> one hundred thirty five Millions of money, which is more by one third then all the Wars since the Conquest, either forreign or other, did cost the Nation; all which are carefully collected, and shall ere long be made appear, to the shame of those dry Spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that have suckt the wealth of the Nation. Well, <hi>Cromwel</hi> now calleth a number of wisemen from <hi>Gotam,</hi> and other parts of the Nation to Council: they call themselves a Parliament, and were about to let him know as much; But some of these wise-men, repair to him, resign their power back to him, and he is made Lord Protector; after he calleth a thing like to a Parliament, and they would not warpe to his Design: he dissolveth them because they could not make Musick of the Instrument of Government.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:152623:27"/>
            <p>He falleth into a Fit of Dislike of his Instrument, and putteth it up into its Case, and calleth another Parliament; excludeth a great part thereof, with the one half, or little more: A <hi>Petition of Advice</hi> it framed; in is He is desired to be a KING: He smelleth the Design, that those who promoted that, did it in order to destroy him: For that then the Cause, and other Pretences must be laid aside, which were good Barres against the <hi>Stuart's</hi> Claim to the Royal Dignity.</p>
            <p>Upon which, He waveth that part of the <hi>Advice,</hi> and accepteth all the rest; is again made Protector. With great ado this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is adjourned: at their next Meeting, the Excluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are admitted, upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aking an Oath to be true to his Highness, <hi>forsooth:</hi> But so soon as these Excluded Members were admitted, they fall to questioning all that had been done before. Some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that they had sworn to be true to the Legal Government. Others answered, They knew none in being that was Legal. Well! He seeing that when they were together, they were not for His Tooth, He contents himself with the <hi>Petition of Advice,</hi> which inableth him to nominate his Successor; to have another House: And as he had not the Confidence to take upon Him the Title of KING; so also had He not the Impudence to call them a House of Lords, since no One in this Nation was a greater Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of designing the Ruine of Both, then Himself. He dyeth, and as it is said, nominateth his Son <hi>Richard</hi> Protector, to succeed Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> calleth this present Parliament; wherein the <hi>Petition of Advice</hi> is wholly set to nought: the great Oppressions, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Inconveniencies of the Times fully debated. To obstruct the Debate thereof, it was alleadged, That all the Members had taken the Oath at their Admission, to be true and obedient to the present Power; and therefore they could not with good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science admit of such Debates.</p>
            <p>To that it was answered, That the best Stamp of the present Power, was Parliamentary Authority, and what was done by one Parliament, might be undone by another: That their Fore-Fathers
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152623:27"/> did formerly, when admitted Members of that House, take the Oath of Allegeance to be true to the KING; and obedient to the Laws in being: Yet notwithstanding, so soon as they came into the Parliament, they Debated of New Laws, and altering of Old; nay, repealing many: Therefore, the Oath binds them as private persons; not as publike persons: else they had been in that point all forsworn.</p>
            <p>That no Parliament can make a Law to binde a Successive Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; but that they may alter what is fit to be altered: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they took in hand the Debate of the <hi>Petition of Advice;</hi> to prevent which some of the New Courtiers bring in a Bill, or Recognition, which hath been variously debated; and upon the Debate,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the Nation shall be governed by a Single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Two Houses of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Now having taken some Orderly View of the various Changes and Turns; and also of the present Position of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though undigested, and unliked; therefore no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made of it what it will be, nor what it may be able to produce, as to Settlement or Security.
